# 1D_exploratoryModel

We built this repository to make our source code available for everybody. 
You will find 3 core files: 
- `binormal.m`: a function to perform normal approximation to binomial
distribution when number of elements is over 1000. 
- `dataProcessing.m`, which we use to calculate mean, 
standard deviation and mean standard error for all variables of interest. We also use this file to 
manipulate files into directories. 
- 
- 
work in local directories 

Julia code files will be available soon.
